#text2test
The application is intended for educational organisations, as a supplementary tool for language, which can be used for individual learning, homeworks, tests, etc. The text2test is programmed in PHP and JavaScript/jQuery, so it should be possible to install the app on any server. It is [open source](https://github.com/AntoninSlejska/text2test/blob/master/LICENCE), so you can use free of charge and without any restrictions.
